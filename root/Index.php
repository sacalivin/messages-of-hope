                    <h3>Breath and Grow</h3>
                    “In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the
                    whole world with an atmosphere of grace as real as the air
                    which circulates around the globe. All who <em>choose to breathe</em>
                    this life-giving atmosphere <em>will live and grow</em> up to
                    the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. “ (STC,68)

                    Friend I ask you to choose to breath the grace of God. It 
                    is free just as air around us.

                    <h3>A right Turn wright to the point</h3>
                    “As the ﬂower turns to the sun, that the bright beams
                    may aid in perfecting its beauty and symmetry,” (STC,68)
                    Friend I think it is something admirable to you to
                    develop into the likeness of Christ, I want to assure you today that
                    it is possible. All you need is to humble yourself like a
                    flower and turn onto the Sun of Righteousness then the
                    heavenly light will shine up you and you character will be
                    transformed onto the likeness of Christ.

                <h3>Without Christ We can absolutely do nothing.</h3>
                Jesus teaches the same thing when He says, 
                “Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear 
                fruit of itself, except
                it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.... 
                <em>Without Me ye can do nothing.”</em> John15:4,5.
                <em>You are just as dependent up on Christ, in order to
                live a holy life,</em> 
                as is the branch upon the parent stock for
                growth and fruitfulness. Apart from Him you have no life. 
                You have no power to resist temptation or to grow in grace and
                holiness. Abiding In Him, you may ﬂourish. 
                Drawing your life from Him, you will not wither nor be fruitless. 
                You will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.
                friends a Christian who has lost hold of Christ has already 
                <em>died</em> as Spiritual death. But hope is still there for
                them. Let us came back to our right senses -like the lost 
                son and turn and get hold onto Christ or Savior. Then we will
                flourish, be fruitful and like a tree planted by the river.
